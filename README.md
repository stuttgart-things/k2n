# /ˈkæf.kən/ (k2n)

the project kaeffken, or in short k2n (/keɪ tuː ɛn/ ) is a cli for generating ai based claims or inlcude statements. The generation is based on examples and rulesets. claims are user-facing Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs) that allow application teams (developers, workloads) to request infrastructure or services without knowing the underlying implementation details.
